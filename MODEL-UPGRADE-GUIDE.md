# AI Model Future-Proofing Implementation

## Overview
This upgrade makes your app automatically improve as new AI models are released, without requiring code changes.

## What Was Added

### 1. Model Registry (`src/ai/model-registry.ts`)
- Central registry of all available models with their capabilities
- Automatic model selection based on task complexity
- Performance tracking for continuous optimization
- Fallback support for graceful degradation

### 2. Model Monitor (`src/ai/model-monitor.ts`)
- Real-time monitoring of model performance
- Automatic recommendations for model upgrades
- Usage statistics and cost tracking
- A/B testing capability for new models

### 3. Intelligent Model Selection
The app now automatically:
- Uses cheaper models for simple tasks (intent detection)
- Uses powerful models for complex tasks (relationship analysis)
- Tracks performance and adjusts selection over time
- Falls back gracefully if preferred models are unavailable

## How It Works

### Before (Static)
```typescript
// Hardcoded model selection
model: 'gpt-4-turbo-preview'
```

### After (Dynamic)
```typescript
// Intelligent selection based on task
model: modelSelector.getOptimalModel('contact_extraction')
```

## Benefits

1. **Cost Optimization**: Automatically uses cheaper models when appropriate
2. **Performance Tracking**: Monitors latency and success rates
3. **Future-Proof**: New models are automatically evaluated and adopted
4. **No Breaking Changes**: Fully backward compatible
5. **Admin Visibility**: New `/models` command shows current status

## Testing New Models

When OpenAI releases a new model (e.g., GPT-5):

1. Add it to the model registry:
```typescript
'gpt-5': {
  contextWindow: 256000,
  costPer1kTokens: { input: 0.002, output: 0.006 },
  quality: 'premium',
  features: { json: true, functions: true, vision: true, streaming: true },
  speed: 'fast'
}
```

2. The system will automatically:
   - Test it against current models
   - Recommend adoption if performance improves
   - Gradually roll it out based on success metrics

## Admin Commands

Use `/models` as an admin to see:
- Current model assignments for each task
- Performance metrics
- Cost optimization recommendations
- Upgrade opportunities

## Configuration

No configuration changes needed! The system uses your existing `OPENAI_API_KEY` and automatically optimizes model selection.

## Monitoring

The system tracks:
- Average latency per model
- Success rates
- Cost per operation
- Usage patterns

## Rollback

If needed, you can force specific models:
```typescript
modelSelector.setModelOverride('contact_extraction', 'gpt-4-turbo-preview');
```

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the `/models` command output regularly
2. Review recommendations for model changes
3. Test new models as they become available
4. Adjust task complexity mappings based on your needs

This implementation ensures your app continuously improves without manual intervention as AI technology advances.
